## Hugo CMS GitHub Action

This repository hosts a GitHub Action that is used in my multiple Hugo CMS private repositories.

It acts as a single source of truth for building multiple Hugo projects (setting the Linux version, the Hugo version, and so on). All projects are simple websites and benefit from a single defined pipeline (instead of having to maintain a CI/CD for each).
